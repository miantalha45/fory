Fory Swift can exchange payloads with other Fory runtimes using the xlang protocol.

## Recommended Cross-language Configuration

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, trackRef: false, compatible: true)
```

## Register Types with Shared Identity

### ID-based registration

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct Order {
    var id: Int64 = 0
    var amount: Double = 0
}

let fory = Fory(xlang: true, compatible: true)
fory.register(Order.self, id: 100)
```

### Name-based registration

```swift
try fory.register(Order.self, namespace: "com.example", name: "Order")
```

## Cross-language Rules

- Keep type registration mapping consistent across languages
- Use compatible mode when independently evolving schemas
- Register all user-defined concrete types used by dynamic fields (`Any`, `any Serializer`)

## Swift IDL Workflow

Generate Swift models directly from Fory IDL/Proto/FBS inputs:

```bash
foryc schema.fdl --swift_out ./Sources/Generated
```

Generated Swift code includes:

- `@ForyStruct`, `@ForyEnum`, `@ForyUnion`, and field/case metadata
- Tagged union enums (associated-value enum cases)
- `ForyRegistration.register(_:)` helpers with transitive import registration
- `toBytes` / `fromBytes` helpers on generated types

Use generated registration before cross-language serialization:

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, trackRef: true, compatible: true)
try Addressbook.ForyRegistration.register(fory)

let payload = try fory.serialize(book)
let decoded: Addressbook.AddressBook = try fory.deserialize(payload)
```

### Run Swift IDL Integration Tests

```bash
cd integration_tests/idl_tests
./run_swift_tests.sh
```

This runs Swift roundtrip matrix tests and Java peer roundtrip checks (`IDL_PEER_LANG=swift`).

## Debugging Cross-language Tests

Enable debug output when running xlang tests:

```bash
ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1 FORY_SWIFT_JAVA_CI=1 mvn -T16 test -Dtest=org.apache.fory.xlang.SwiftXlangTest
```
